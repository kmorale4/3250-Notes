DESIGN PATTERNS
-Wikipedia defines design patterns as a genral reusable solution to a common problem
-Pretty much are formalized best practices
+Benefits 
-creates a shared vocabiulary
-keeps thinking/ designing at the abstract level
    creates more flexable and reusable code
ORIGIN
+in 1987, kent beck and ward cunningham began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming.
CHRISTOPHER ALEXANDER
+in software he is thought of as the father of design patterns
+the first wiki (the tech behind wiki ) inspired him to create them

GROUPS AND CONCEPTS
+Design patterns were oruginally grouped onto the categories: 
    -creation patterns
    -structural 
    -behavioral

+And described using the concepts of 
    -delegation
    -aggregation
    -consultation

AEI and o plus onesaying to remember the core concepts of programming

FIRST DESIGN PRINCIPLE
    -Identify the aspects of your application that vary and seperate them from what stays the same 
    -You can alter ot extend without affevting other patterns
    -Basis of almost every design pattern
    
SECOND DESIGN PRINCIPLE
    -Program to an interface not an implementation
        -not necessarily a java interfce 
        -program to a supertype
            -private Map<String, Boolean> urls = new concurrentHashMap<String,Boolean>();
        -can then better use polymorphism
        -can more easily change implementation
        -declare variables at highest abstraction level

THIRD DESIGN PRINCIPLE 
    -favors composition over inheritance
    -favors a has-a relationship over is-a relationship
    -inheritance limits reusablility

THE STRATEGY PATTERN
    -a behavioral pattern
    -defines a family of algorithms,encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable
    -strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the client that uses it

FROM CHAPTER ONE IN DESIGN PATTERNS BOOK

CHAPTER 2 IN DESIGN PATTERS BOOK

THE OBSERVER PATTERN
    -defines a one to many dependancy between objects 
    -an object is called an object,called the subject , maintains a list of dependencies called observers and notifies them automaticaaly of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods
    -mostly used in event driven software
    -the observer pattern is a key part of the mvc system

LANGUAGES 
    -java has observable,observe state etc.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES 
    -strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
    -objects have little information about wach other 
    -no shared data
