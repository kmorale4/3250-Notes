Iterator pattern 
    -provides a way to access the elements of an aggrefate object 
    In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.
    For example, the hypothetical algorithm SearchForElement can be implemented generally using a specified type of iterator rather than implementing it as a container-specific algorithm. This allows SearchForElement to be used on any container that supports the required type of iterator.
JAVA
    -Enumeration is the older that has been replaced by iterator 
        iterator allows removal

Design principle 
    -a class should hace only one reason to change
        single responsibility principle
    -High cohision 
        all methodws related to purpose

Composite pattern 
    -allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part/whole hierarchies
    -composite allows clients to treat individual objects and composition of objects uniformly
    -we can apply the same operations over both composite and individual objects
    -can ignore differences between the two 
    -think recursion

Part/Whole 
    animals, mammals, cats..
        repiration, other similar features
    objects in scene 
        texture,placement,etc

DESIGN PATTERNS 10

THE STATE PATTERNS
    State 
        -the combination of the value of all the variables in an object
        -we use state machines all the time
            nfas,dfas
        -automata
            combinational logic 
            fsms(finite state machines)
            pushdown
            turing machines

    State
        -vending machines, elevator,locks, traffic, lights,etc
        -FSMS limited to the amount of memory it has

   State pattern    
    -allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes
    -the object will appear to change its class
    -very similar ro strategy pattern
